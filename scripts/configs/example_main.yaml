  # g^ a ranking generated by ssm is used as a base for Greedy
  # d^ a ranking generated by ssm is used as a base for Min. Dominating Set (ver. get_mds_greedy)
  # D^ a ranking generated by ssm is used as a base for Min. Dominating Set (ver. get_mds_locimpr)
  # there is also option to append Greedy to the MDS-based methods, e.g. g^d^deg_c
  # it is forbidden to use Greedy based methods and Non-greedy within the same configuration file
